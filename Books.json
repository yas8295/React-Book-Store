        "name": "Three Men in a Boat",
        "description": "<p><p>by Jerome K. Jerome <em> (Author)</em></p><p><strong>Three Men in a Boat</strong> was first published in 1889. It is the fictional story of three London friends and a dog taking a leisurely boat trip up the River Thames, from Kingston-upon-Thames to Oxford. It is narrated by ‘J.’, whose companions are George (awarded no surname), William Samuel Harris and the dog, Montmorency. During a sociable evening in J.’s room, the three men convince themselves that they each have various illnesses. Their collective diagnosis is overwork, and they prescribe themselves a fortnight’s holiday.  George must work in the City in the morning, and so arranges to join them later that day. The other two, accompanied by the dog and a mountain of luggage, get a cab to Waterloo station, but are unable to find the correct train to Kingston. Eventually they bribe the driver of another train to take them there instead, one of the many humorous set-pieces that make the book more than a straightforward travelogue. George completes the trio at Weybridge, with a dubious-looking parcel tucked under his arm, which turns out to be a banjo and instruction book. The story is a tapestry of incidents that occur, anecdotes on various topics (including the unreliability of weather forecasts), loosely connected digressions (such as J.'s uncle’s inability to hang pictures), and descriptive pieces on the places that they pass. It is in these descriptive pieces that the author’s original intention of writing a guidebook is most apparent. What he actually achieved was a classic of British humorous writing. Although the book was written over a century ago, it has an enduring, timeless quality.</p></p>",

Othello who is a noble black warrior in the Venetian army that secretly married a beautiful white woman called Desdemona who is the daughter of a prominent senator named Brabantio. When he eventually finds out and is completely furious he decides to disown Desdemona.Iago has a secret jealousy and resentment towards Othello because a soldier named Lieutenant Cassio has been put in front of him and also suspects that Othello has been cheating with his wife. Waiting on revenge, Iago plans a devious comeback to plant suspicions in Othello’s mind that Desdemona has been having an affair with Cassio. He decided to start a street fight which Cassio is blamed for, and is then dismissed from his post by Othello. Desdemona takes up Cassio’s case with her husband, which only increases his suspicions that the pair are lovers.While all of this is happening Iago manages to find a treasured handkerchief from Desdemona that was given to her by Othello. He somehow gets the handkerchief on Cassio so that Othello sees it and he finally concludes that the possession is proof of the affair. Due to the jealousy, he orders Iago to murder Cassio. Then Othello decides to strangle Desdemona. Immediately afterwards her innocence is revealed, and Iago’s treachery exposed. In a fit of grief and remorse Othello kills himself and Iago is taken into custody by the authorities.</p></p>",

Packed with erudition and analysis, it expounds the idea of a moral and spiritual growth for human welfare. the lectures—written in a lucid, metaphoric, poetic prose—are loaded with a piercing vision of the future and are a critique on his views on spirituality and humanity.Tagore was a farsighted visionary, whose forebodings on the lack of human values and the political role of the nation and the state in the East and the West are well articulated in these lectures. Tagore discusses the revival of the East and the challenge it poses to the Western reign, calling for a future based on tolerance, a future where tradition and modernity are balanced.Tagore’s Nationalism holds much relevance in today’s environment of violence and intolerance.</p></p>",

        "description": "<p><p>by Helen Keller <em> (Author)</em></p><p><strong>The Story of My Life Summary:</strong> The Story of my life is the story of Helen Keller who triumphed over adversity and became world famous. She was born on June 27, 1880 in Tuscumbia, Alabama. Her parents were Captain Arthur Henry Keller, a confederate army veteran and a newspaper editor and Kate Adams Keller. She was born as a normal child. But at the age of 19 months, she suffered an illness that left her deaf and blind. Her family wondered how a deaf and blind child could be educated. At the age of six, her mother managed to get a teacher, Anne Sullivan, to teach Helen. After studying at the Wright Humason School for the Deaf and the Cambridge School for Young ladies, she entered Radcliff College in 1900 and finished her graduation in 1904.</p><p>The Story of My Life is a true example that Helen’s life is neither a miracle nor a joke. With the help of her teacher, Anne Sullivan, Helen became an inter-nationally recognized and respected figure. In 1908 Helen published “The World I Live In”, an account of how she experienced the world through touch, taste and scent.</p></p>",

It contains the earliest short stories featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, which had been published in twelve monthly issues of <em>The Strand Magazine</em> from July 1891 to June 1892. The stories are collected in the same sequence, which is not supported by any fictional chronology. The only characters common to all twelve are Holmes and Dr. Watson and all are related in first-person narrative from Watson's point of view.</p><p>In general the stories in <em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em> identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of <em>The Strand Magazine</em>, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, \\\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\\", includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking \\\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\\" as his overall favourite.</p></p>",

        "description": "<p><p>by Charles Darwin <em> (Author)</em></p><p>Darwin’s theory is based on the notion of variation. It argues that the numerous traits and adaptations that differentiate species from each other also explain how species evolved over time and gradually diverged. Variations in organisms are apparent both within domesticated species and within species throughout the natural world. Variations in colors, structures, organs, and physical traits differentiate a multitude of species from one another. Heredity is the mechanism that perpetuates variations, Darwin argues, as traits are passed from parents to offspring. What is important about these variations to Darwin, though, is the way they allow species to adapt and survive in the natural world. He gives numerous examples of variations that illustrate the wondrous adaptations that allow species to survive in their natural environments: the beak that allows the woodpecker to gather insects, the wings that allow the bat to fly, the paddles that allow the porpoise to swim, and so on. Darwin hypothesizes that the minor variations we see within a single species—such as variations in size, shape, and color of organisms—are related to the more distinct variations seen across different species. His theory of evolution explains how variations cause the origin of species.</p></p>",

It is an expanded version of the short story \\\"Sara Crewe: or, What Happened at Miss Minchin's\\\", which was serialized in St. Nicholas Magazine from December 1887, and published in book form in 1888. According to Burnett, after she composed the 1902 play A Little Un-fairy Princess based on that story, her publisher asked that she expand the story as a novel with \\\"the things and people that had been left out before\\\". Captain Ralph Crewe, a wealthy English widower, has been raising his only child, Sara, in India where he is stationed with the British Army. Because the Indian climate is considered too harsh for children, British families living there traditionally send their children to boarding school back home in England.</p></p>",

Yes, we shall drive every blasted Englishman into the sea.” on that fateful day, when Dr. Aziz took Mrs. Moore and Miss adela quest to the famous marabar caves, he had no idea that his whole life was about to turn upside down. All Aziz had done was kindly offer to show the ‘real’ India to the two englishwomen who had newly arrived in his country. But on the day of the excursion, upon returning from the caves, he was slapped with the accusation of a sexual assault. What happens when Aziz is brought to Court? Does the man get justice? Or has his race earmarked him for prison? Set in the fictional town of Chandernagore, in the pre-Independence era of India, a passage to India portrays colonialism, racial prejudice, and the dynamics of Anglo-Indian relations with striking realism. Considered forster’s most successful novel, it was adapted into a film in 1984, and was featured in time magazine list of hundred best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.</p></p>",

A beautiful woman in white haunts the Lonely pathways, looking to enchant and ensnare men... All the people who died in accidents here... They say you hear their screams at night. And the deserted lodges sitting amidst lush greenery and calm streams... Spirits lie in wait here, ready to prey on the living. There are sceptics who did not heed these warnings.
